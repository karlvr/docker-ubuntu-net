To install Varnish on Mac OS, there are some hoops to jump through.

As at 2017-02-03, these are the steps required to run Varnish locally for Letterboxd:

> brew edit varnish

Change the version number on the source file to `https://repo.varnish-cache.org/source/varnish-4.1.4.tar.gz`

Change the expected SHA to `sha256 "44fdeb66fb27af9c18fde6123ef7b0038d6d263c7999a02a780ce4ea1a3965fc"`

> brew install varnish

If it complains about the SHA hash, brew edit again and update the hash to what it said it needed then run brew install varnish again.

You should now be able to go to the letterboxd-scripts root directory and run

> bin/varnish-local.sh

If it complains `Could not load VMOD geoip`

> brew install geoip

If it complains `Could not load VMOD digest`

> brew install mhash

Make sure you're running with

> bin/varnish-local.sh

It needs your sudo password to start up.

Configure Charles to have a Reverse Proxy on port 8082 that connects to your tomcat server (grant.office.cactuslab.com, or whatever) on port 8080 (or whichever port you use) with "Preserve Host Header" off.
This way, Varnish will make a request to Charles with the host name that you request Varnish with (localhost or whatever)
and Charles will then make a request to the backend app server, passing in its own name, so it will serve the request.

Make a request to `http://grant.office.cactuslab.com:8081/letterboxd/`
